## 📄 Project Overview

The Smart Smoke & Gas Detector is an IoT-based early warning system designed to detect smoke, temperature spikes, and hazardous gas leaks. The system integrates sensors, microcontrollers, and cloud-based alerts to provide real-time safety monitoring. Optional advanced features include ML-based predictive alerts, location awareness, and gas type identification.

## 🗂️ Repository Structure

* `Docs/` : Project proposal, design documents, PDFs
* `Hardware/` : Wiring diagrams, breadboard layouts, sensor schematics
* `Software/` : ESP32 Arduino code, Python ML scripts
* `Cloud/` : Cloud dashboard scripts and configurations

## 🌟 Features

* 🔥 **Real-time Detection:** Monitors smoke, temperature, and gas concentrations
* 📡 **Alerts:** Local buzzer/LED notifications + cloud/mobile notifications
* 🤖 **Predictive Alerts:** Optional ML model to predict hazardous conditions before thresholds are crossed
* 🏠 **Multi-Room Awareness:** Pinpoints the exact location of hazard using multiple sensors
* ⚡ **Automated Response:** Optional relay control for fans or LEDs
* 📊 **Data Logging:** Historical data visualization through cloud dashboard
* 🧪 **Gas Type Classification:** Optional ML-based detection of gas type (LPG, CO, smoke, etc.)

## ✅ Current Status

* Project proposal and initial documentation uploaded (`Docs/`)
* Hardware planning and sensor selection completed
* Repo set up for future code, schematics, and cloud integration

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. Implement basic ESP32 code to read sensor data
2. Connect sensors and verify thresholds
3. Develop cloud dashboard for real-time monitoring
4. Integrate optional ML features for predictive alerts and gas classification
5. Update documentation and README as project progresses
